# Description:
    A very Basic platformer game that I want to do.
    Not much changed from my first idea, mostly just the appearance of the game

# Instructions:
    Probably need pygame to operate
    Controls are AWD
    There are some loud sound so recommended to lower the volume before playing

# Things I want to do if I had more time:
    More levels for the game
    Bigger Map
    Better NPCs
    More Items and Actions
